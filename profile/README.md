# Another [Revaea](https://revaea.com): Kindred Spirit of the Sea

In the beginning, the world may have been a single, slumbering sapphire—  
silent and weighty, sealing away light that had yet to awaken.  
Then, somehow, someone overturned a bottle brimming with light—  
a clear, ringing sound, and the gem shattered.  
Yet that hand did not withdraw. With patience and gentleness, it gathered the broken blue, piecing it back together, and so the world learned how to breathe.  

And thus, the sea gained its depth.  

Look at the surface of the sea now: no longer a single blur of color.  
Tides and undercurrents, like meticulous craftsmen, carve and arrange it, assembling a map of interwoven shades.  
In the depths lies a condensed indigo, like an eye lost in solitary midnight thought, holding fallen yet unextinguished stars;  
along the shallows spreads a lucid azure, like glassy candy wrappers rinsed again and again by sunlight—light, translucent, almost ready to lift into the sky with the light itself.  
They interlock and respond to one another, as if a grand exposition devoted solely to blue were unfolding, quietly stretching to the edge of the horizon beneath a windless noon.  

There is no clamor here—only rhythm.  

The wind is the world’s pianist.  
When it sweeps across the sea, white crests line up of their own accord, winding and rising like a staff written upon the water.  
Leaping droplets and silver fish skimming the surface become the notes that wander across it.  
You hear no mechanical roar—only the clear, lingering sound of waves striking rock:  
ding—dong—.  
That is the sea breathing; every rise and fall is a line of poetry not yet finished.  

And at the very center of this endless blue  
floats a pale silence.  

It is an island, and also like a moon of daylight that has never set.  
So white it is almost transparent, so white it is nearly lonely.  
It belongs neither to the melancholy of deep blue nor to the joy of light blue; it simply stands there, quietly, casting a cool and gentle glow.  
It is the final refuge of wandering tides, the only—and necessary—rest in this blue symphony.  

All sounds slow their steps here.  
All shades of blue grow clear.  

If you arrive at this place, please, do not speak.  
Simply become a cloud, or even a grain of salt—  
and dissolve into this interwoven blue, and the eternal, unchanging white.
